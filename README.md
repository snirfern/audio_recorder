Audio recorder app - using nodejs , react , mongodb database

The assignemnt

1. Once a session is completed a WAV file is downloded containing the recording. Upload the WAV file to a server instead of it being downloaded.

2. Create a webpage to display a list of all the uploaded recordings along with the recording time, creation date and an option to play it.

3. Currently the app downloads multiple CSVs with data. Instead, use SocketIO to stream the data contniously the moment a recording starts. The streamed data should be console.log'd on the server.
